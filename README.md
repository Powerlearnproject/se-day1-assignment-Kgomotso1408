Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and

maintaining software.

reliability- it ensures agile software performs as decribed on the product documentation without any skewedness especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance.

efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.

scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.

security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

object-oriented programminng(oop)
software testing
design

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
requirement analysis - identify the final user specification.
design - building the framework.
coding - converting software design into tangible code.
testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches
maintenance-constatly improving the software to keep up   with the requirements of the user.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
- maintaining and updating software to keep it functional.
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
- reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
- create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
- confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment.
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more
efficient.
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
- discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
- create blueprint for the project.
- tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
- deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.
  
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates
the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and
debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg
Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
-An IDE complies the code into a simplified language that tthe operating system can understand 
-An IDE allows simplified debugging as it go`s through the code line by line to correct errors and as it inspects the codes behavior.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git

Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification.
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Time constraints-software development is a demanding field and it requires aan engineer to be flexiable under pressure.

liimited infrastructure-limited high performance tools and computing platforms.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual
methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. -it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.

Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
- help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
-It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements,
including performance, usability, and security.

Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business
requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors.

#Part 2: Introducti1.

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.

Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.

Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.

developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
snake and ladder 
create a snake and ladder game that is played by two player,each player pick the color the are going to play with from the red and white. the game must have 5 snake and 5 ladder and have 10 stages 

clarity-the improve prompt specifies what is asked which is a game of two players and a number of stages to be played.
specific details-the game is define to the fullest with specifics such as the number of snakes and ladders and stages.
concise-the other details define the type of game required without any complicated parts thus it is much easy to make game
